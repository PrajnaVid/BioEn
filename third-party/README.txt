Bundled copies of GSL and LIBLBFGS
==================================


Use the script

`install_dependencies.sh`

to conveniently install these libraries into your homedirectory.


As a second step, install the bioen package, e.g., using

python setup.py install --user

which will detect and use the installation of GSL and LIBLBFGS.
